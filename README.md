👋 Hi, I’m @humayltm, Humayl Malik.
👀 I’m interested in AI, Machine Learning, and the vast potential they hold in transforming our world.
🌱 I’m currently diving deep into advanced AI algorithms as a junior CS major at Oregon State University.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in AI.
👍 This github profile is a work in progress...hopefully it forever will be! :)
